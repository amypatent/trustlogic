## Overview

TrustLogic introduces a dual-token architecture that separates **authority** from **user rights**, enabling true on-chain enforceability without compromising privacy.

- **Trustee Token**: Holds authority — defines rules, automates royalties, enables revocation, and enforces governance.
- **Beneficiary Token**: Grants user rights — revocable, transferable under defined conditions, with full transaction-graph anonymity and no PII stored on-chain.

This design solves the core limitation of existing digital assets: lack of real enforceability combined with privacy risks.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First**: No personally identifiable information on-chain; compliance checked off-chain.
- **Revocable Access**: Authority holders can revoke rights instantly when conditions are breached.
- **Automated Royalties**: Built-in royalty enforcement across primary and secondary transfers.
- **Governed Transfers**: Purpose-bound assets, spending rules, and conditional transfers.
- **Cross-Platform Enforcement**: Works across media, AI datasets, finance, ticketing, and public infrastructure.

## Use Cases

- Media & IP: Guaranteed royalties for music, film, games, images, and datasets
- AI Training Data: Enforceable licensing and revocation for proprietary datasets
- Finance: Purpose-bound stablecoins, grants with spending controls
- Ticketing: Anti-scalping, transferable yet revocable event access
- Public Goods: Governed funding and conditional resource allocation
