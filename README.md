# TrustLogic
TrustLogic is an enforceability layer for digital assets and digital value. Using a dual-token architecture, the protocol encodes authority, obligations, royalties, revocation logic, and dispute routing in a Trustee Token, while user rights are represented as revocable, non-transferable Beneficiary Tokens. This separation allows rules to follow rights across wallets, chains, and marketplaces, enabling enforceable IP licensing, AI dataset governance, fraud-resistant claims, purpose-bound payments, and semi-decentralized financial rails. This repository hosts the TrustLogic whitepaper, diagrams, and versioned documentation.
